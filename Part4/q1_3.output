Part 4: Eating Some Pi
1.	We’ve extended the .cpp file to include the OpenMPI routines to run on four nodes; by including the necessary changes in the .cpp file, then executing ‘mpiexec -n 4 ser_calc_pi’ 
2.	Once making the .cpp adjustments, we then execute and get the following for our 1,000,000th iteration and total runtime under the different rank/node distributions:

mpiexec -n 1 ./ser_pi_calc_p2:
After 1000000 throws, average value of pi = 3.15120000
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.036455 seconds
mpiexec -n 2 ./ser_pi_calc_p2
After 1000000 throws, average value of pi = 3.13600000
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.020246 seconds

mpiexec -n 3 ./ser_pi_calc_p2
After 1000000 throws, average value of pi = 3.13111311
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.014873 seconds

mpiexec -n 4 ./ser_pi_calc_p2
After 1000000 throws, average value of pi = 3.12960000
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.012719 seconds

3.	Below is the results and runtimes after we divide the number of rounds amongst the different ranks.  There are clear improvements in the runtime calculations as we distribute above 1 rank:

mpiexec -n 1 ./ser_pi_calc_p3:
Starting parallel version of pi calculation using dartboard algorithm...
After 100 rounds, average value of pi = 3.14174400
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.035544 seconds

mpiexec -n 2 ./ser_pi_calc_p3
Starting parallel version of pi calculation using dartboard algorithm...
After 100 rounds, average value of pi = 3.14193600
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.009178 seconds

mpiexec -n 3 ./ser_pi_calc_p3
Starting parallel version of pi calculation using dartboard algorithm...
After 100 rounds, average value of pi = 3.14744202
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.005017 seconds

mpiexec -n 4 ./ser_pi_calc_p4
Starting parallel version of pi calculation using dartboard algorithm...
   		After 100 rounds, average value of pi = 3.14291200
Real value of PI: 3.1415926535897 
Total runtime: 0.003087 seconds
